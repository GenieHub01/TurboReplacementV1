                                <p class="answer">Turbo whistle is normally caused by either an air leak on the engine , so check all the air system from air box to turbo, and turbo to intercooler, intercooler to inlet manifold, both inlet and exhaust manifold gaskets and finally turbo to exhaust pipe, this can easily done by using a gas leak or smoke test machine, which most vehicle diagnostic garages can do for you at low cost.</p>
                                <p class="answer">The other thing which can cause a turbo to whistle is the turbo nozzle ring or turbo vanes get stuck with carbon, causing the turbo vanes to be stuck in full boost and overspeed the turbochargers beyond its standard speed/ balancing range causing a turbo whistle. These turbo problems are caused by either injectors not working properly, oil in the intercooler or an engine breather problem.</p>
